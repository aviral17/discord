A) For image uploads using ----> uploadthings (uploadthing.com)

a) Create new app b) Fill App name and leave other field empty    c) Copy API Keys and paste it in .env

NOTE: 

B) Getting Started and install packages ---> a)  Again copy the packages like dropzones and install it  and b) We already setup the .env files so no need to check that again

C) Inside Next.js setup App Router (app/) ---> Setting up File Router   and changing `core.ts` as per our requirements  and also for `route.ts` as per instructions

D) Again, they asking to create file `uploadthing.ts` inside utils folder, but we keeping att utils type files inside lib folder so using lib folder instead of utils folder

NOTE: Also dont forget to define the public routes in `middleware.ts`, check middleware.ts for more info
