A) I am using pri...50...il.com email  for Clerk integration

After setting up email providers and saving .env variables in .env file -------> https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs

a) npm install @clerk/nextjs  b) Inside ROOT layout.tsx of app folder -----> mount <clerkprovider /> NOTE: That we have App router instead of Page Router 

c) Add middleware.ts and add contents as per clerk instructions  

d) Do follow the instructions and make sure to only copy the code of App Router instead of Page Router. Make sure you create sign-up or sign-in inside (routes) as per my way of doing it as keeping inside (routes) will have the same url in browser but it can be easily identified with (routes) className
